- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I chose to overload mostly constructors, and the buy coffee method for the cafe class. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was fine, but it does take a lot of organization and ordering to remember which classes and constructors have which elements first, so it gets quite confusing. But overall it was quite easy.
